The dataset includes 1148 images.
Car are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -31 and +31 percent
* Random exposure adjustment of between -9 and +9 percent
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 1 percent of pixels
